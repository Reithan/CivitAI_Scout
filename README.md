# CivitAI Scout
Search and sort Civit.ai models by multiple metrics.

## What it does
- Search the latest models by time period, type, and base model
- Sort only these latest models by downloads, ratings, comments, buzz (tips), or a composite score
- View model stats on each tile
- Blur NSFW content if needed

## Composite Score
The score combines three signals:
- **Downloads**: How many people grabbed it
- **Thumbs**: Engagement quality vs. expected ratio
- **Tips (Buzz)**: Community financial support

Models with high downloads AND tips rank higher. Good engagement on small samples matters less as download count goes up.

## Usage
Enter a search term (or leave blank for recent models), adjust filters, and pick a sort method.
